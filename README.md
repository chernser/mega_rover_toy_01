# mega_rover_toy_01
Remote controller car (rover) for my son. 


Description
===========

This is project of remote controlled car for my son. He is too young to wire it by himself, but he is very excited watching I'm making it work. 
Only well known components are used (what can be found on amazon.com and sparkfun). 

The initial goal was: 
1. Make car go in four directions  
2. Simple control 
3. Have some sort of additional tools, like grip, flashlight

What will be next: 
1. Build stackable circuit and put all electronics on it
2. Make independent control of each wheel
